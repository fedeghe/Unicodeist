        - move it to the bottom (z-index)
        - center horizontally *
        - center vertically *

    - change the `font-weight` of the symbol
    - change the `color` of the symbol
    - tune `scale`, `scaleX`, `rotationX`, `rotationY`, `scaleY`, `rotationZ`

        to move a symbol there are also other options:

        - when focused press `shift + arrow` (1px move each)

To move all symbols together just go to the logo in the right upper part and drag it in one direction, you will move all simbols together in that direction for an amout proportional to the movement.
