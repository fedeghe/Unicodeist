- In the top right you can:
    - set the size of the current _creative_
    - switch ðŸŒ“ theme
    - export a `.json` file of the current _creative_
    - import one of the exported `.json` files
    - change the `background-color` (default is white)
    - email the html of the _creative_ to someone
    - get the content as `<div>` usable in a html page or a `<script>` that will automatically render it exactly where you put the script.

- Press the âž• button on the top left (or press `ESC` button) to toggle the symbol selection panel  
- Add one or more symbols and close the panel (through âž– button or pressing `ESC`)  
- Last symbol added is the current target one, thus on the right panel you will see a tuning card expanded allowing you to: 
    - set a label for it (only useful to search it among added symbols)
    - set the `z-index`
    - see a preview showing on its left some icons to:
        - throw it away 
        - isolate that from others (useful to be sure to change the right symbol)
        - clone it  (when clicked, the clone will be automatically the target)
        - bring it to the top (z-index)
        - move it to the bottom (z-index)
        - center horizontally *
        - center vertically *  
            
    - change the `font-family` of the symbol  
    - change the `font-weight` of the symbol
    - change the `color` of the symbol
    - tune `scale`, `scaleX`, `rotationX`, `rotationY`, `scaleY`, `rotationZ`
    - move the symbol in a different location:  
        - using the range inputs
        - drag the symbol
        - when focused press <span style="padding:0px 2px;font-size:1.5em;position:relative;top:2px;border:1px solid gray">â‡§ + arrow</span> (1px move each)

### Move all symbols
To move all symbols together just go to the logo in the right upper part and drag it in one direction, you will move all simbols together in that direction for an amout proportional to the movement.
